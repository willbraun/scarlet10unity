Scarlet 10
I created an video game version of Scarlet 10, which is a card game from China that my friend Charles introduced to me. I have some experience coding and wanted to build something to see if I could do it. I liked this idea as a project to pursue so I could use it as a tool to practice. 
This project is currently published online here - https://play.unity.com/mg/other/scarlet-10-1
All instructions are in the game itself in the How to Play button.
Features
  Right now a user can play through multiple games, and the game will keep score along the way.
  Computer players will search through all card combinations and pick a random legal move to play.
  The program automatically cycles through the players in order, however, it is possible for any player to steal the turn out of order in the right circumstance.
Future enhancements I would like to build
  Animation of the cards from one location to another, rather than just updating the position
  Rules to determine which hand a computer player should play so the games are more realistic
  Multiplayer support
  
Thank you for playing!
